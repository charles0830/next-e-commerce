<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I saw a UI design on Dribbble by [Anton Mikhaltsov](https://dribbble.com/shots/9404340-Shop-Clothing-Web-Page). And I wanted to code this design. So I decided to make it a full working website with NextJS but in just 1 week as challenge myself. Some issues are still there but I will check out them later.

- Filter and Sort buttons are not working yet.
- Website is not responsive %100 because of time was not enought. I am working on it currently. It will be published soon.
- Firebase functions could be better
- Home page(News In) cards has no redirects. They are just placeholders.

Except home page, other UI choices is mine. While I made this website in limited time, I did not think on UI/UX a lot. So you can also feedback me about design.
